# Unscented-Kalman-Filter-to-track-robot-orientation-3D
Python implementation of an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to track the orientation of a robot in three dimensions given observations from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that consists of gyroscopes and accelerometers and corresponding data from a motion-capture system called Vicon.
